# pythonHomework

Here is my homework, which I did myself. Each individual python file implements a function. 
The purpose of the assignment is to become familiar with Python while accumulating programming experience.

Every time I finish my homework, I upload it. 
Each Python file is a separate job with detailed comments and complete code in the job. 
The code can be run directly, and the job requirements are completed. 
The job requirements are visible at the beginning of each Python file.
